# Property-Management-System-OOP
This is a property management system in python.
A porperty agent can manage different properties and details.
It is a menu driven program that is easy to use.
User can add a property type and its details. The propgram will ask itself the different details of the property
User can display all properties you have added.
User can display specific type of properties as well.
User can also modify a property if he needs.
It does not save the previous data once the program ends. I will try to attach data base to resolve this issue in future.
Its not a GUI based propgram. Hoping to do it in future as well.
Enjoy!
